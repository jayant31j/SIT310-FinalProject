BlackLine Maze Runner Project | Personal Project
June 2023 - August 2024

•⁠  ⁠Developed an autonomous maze-solving robot using C++ programming language

•⁠  ⁠Implemented line-following algorithms for precise navigation and path tracking

•⁠  ⁠Created a system capable of detecting and following black lines for maze traversal

•⁠  ⁠Demonstrated practical application of robotics and automation principles

•⁠  ⁠Showcased problem-solving skills through successful implementation of path-finding algorithms

•⁠  ⁠Applied embedded systems programming concepts in a real-world robotics project

•⁠  ⁠Independently managed the entire project lifecycle from conception to implementation
